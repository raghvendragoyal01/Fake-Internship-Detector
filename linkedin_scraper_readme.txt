Async LinkedIn scraper built with Playwright for extracting profile, company, and job data from LinkedIn.

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes in v3.0.0

**Version 3.0.0 introduces breaking changes and is NOT backwards compatible with previous versions.**

### What Changed:
- **Playwright instead of Selenium** - Complete rewrite using Playwright for better performance and reliability
- **Async/await throughout** - All methods are now async and require `await`
- **New package structure** - Imports have changed (e.g., `from linkedin_scraper import PersonScraper`)
- **Updated data models** - Using Pydantic models instead of simple objects
- **Different API** - Method signatures and return types have changed

### Migration Guide:

**Before (v2.x with Selenium):**
```python
from linkedin_scraper import Person

person = Person("https://linkedin.com/in/username", driver=driver)
print(person.name)
```

**After (v3.0+ with Playwright):**
```python
import asyncio
from linkedin_scraper import BrowserManager, PersonScraper

async def main():
    async with BrowserManager() as browser:
        await browser.load_session("session.json")
        scraper = PersonScraper(browser.page)
        person = await scraper.scrape("https://linkedin.com/in/username")
        print(person.name)

asyncio.run(main())
```

**If you need the old Selenium-based version:**
```bash
pip install linkedin-scraper==2.11.2
```
